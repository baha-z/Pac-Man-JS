Javascript Pac-Man 
=============

This is a (just for fun) version of pac-man using Javascript. Any suggestions on how to improve the code or the game are welcome. This was made just to learn some new things and improve my skills, probably will update it later

Base idea was taken from the Udemy course [HTML5 Game from scratch step by step learning JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/html5-game-from-scratch-step-by-step-learning-javascript/learn/v4/overview) by Laurence Svekis, this is my improved version adding more functionality, different assets and other game elements.

Pac Man it's an original game from Namco developed by Toru Iwatani.
